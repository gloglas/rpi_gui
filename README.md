# GUI for P4wnP1
* Colorful UI interface for P4wnP1 ALOA
* Don't pwn just as a USB client. Use also the USB host capabilities!
* UPS Lite support
* Scalability (I tried my best to make it easier to add new menus)

![Main menu](md_files/main.png)

I wanted to use also USB host capabilites of the P4wnP1.

So I implemented few scripts like Keystrokes->Duckyscript, Logitech dump with more scripts TODO; to make it more swissarmyknife like.

* Deploy HID attacks, templates
* Gamepad

## ‚öô Setup
### Hardware
![Layout](md_files/layout.png)
#### üìù Requirements:
* Raspberry PI 0WH (02W untested)
* SD card
* [128x128 (1.44") Waveshare LCD HAT with joystick](https://www.waveshare.com/1.44inch-lcd-hat.htm)
* [UPS Lite - 1000 mAh battery module](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32954180664.html)
* *optionally* [USB adapter](https://www.waveshare.com/pi-zero-usb-adapter.htm)

#### üó° For logitech attacks
* Any nRF52840 Dongle compatible with [LOGITacker firmware](https://github.com/RoganDawes/LOGITacker)
* USB HUB
* USB OTG cable

#### üî® Hardware tips

If you are planning to use the USB adapter you cannot solder it straight to the RPI.

You will need to place it under the UPS lite, because you will not be able to plug it in a laptop.


If you want smaller device you can shorten the pins on the raspberry pi. But I do not recommend it.

Instead solder new pins from bottom, with LCD had on them.

### üßæ Software

Download latest [P4wnP1 aloa image](https://github.com/RoganDawes/P4wnP1_aloa/releases) on sdcard.

```bash
cd /root/
git clone https://github.com/gloglas/rpi_gui
sudo ./rpi_gui/setup.sh
```

If there are no errors just `reboot` your pi and you are set! 

## üíæ Config

It can be saved/loaded from *options* menu.

```json

    }
}
```

## üíª Making your own menu

The menu class has its own structure. I'll try to explain it to you the best I can.

### Menu

Key `"a"` is a definition for menu.

If you are in `"ab"` menu and go one menu back, it will go to the `"a"` menu.

#### Items and structure

The items in menu in menu are in array.

First value is text displayed to the user.

The second value is:

* Menu which will be displayed next (specified by [a-z]) - `"ab"`
* Function with own stuff - `ShowInfo`
* Function with parameter - `[Templates, "WIFI"]` or `[SetColor, 2]`

```python
menu = {
    "a": (
        ["System info", ShowInfo],
        ["HID", "ab"],
        ["Logitech attacks", "ac"],
        ["USB tools", "ad"],
        ["Template selector", "aa"],
        ["Other features","ag"],
        ["Options", "ae"],
        ["System", "af"]
    ),
    "aa": (
        ["Full settings", [Templates, "FULL_SETTINGS"]],
        ["WiFi", [Templates, "WIFI"]],
    ..snip..
    "aea": (
        ["Background", [SetColor, 0]],
        ["Text", [SetColor, 2]],
    ..snip..
}
```

So If you want to add your own you just follow the example.

#### Function called from menu

Requires:

* It is recommended to set where we are (basically just that we are not in menu) with - `m.which = m.which + "1"`
* Draw empty background - `color.DrawMenuBackground()`
* Wait a few milliseconds so the user doesn't accidentally presses some button - `time.sleep(0.4)`
* After leaving the function, set the location accordingly with - `m.which = m.which[:-1]`

```python
def ShowInfo():
    m.which = m.which + "1"
    color.DrawMenuBackground()
    time.sleep(0.4)
    
    # Your stuff here

    m.which = m.which[:-1]
```

### üëç Helper functions
